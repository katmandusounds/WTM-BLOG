#### 4.4 One-Shots from Any Track (Auto-Detection)

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)  
**Status:** 📋 Future (v2.0)

**Overview:**

This feature automatically detects and extracts individual one-shot samples from uploaded audio tracks. Using advanced AI stem separation and intelligent audio analysis, the system will identify drums, bass (808s), and melodic instruments, then automatically slice them into usable one-shots with different detection thresholds optimized for each type.

**Requirements:**

1. **Automatic Stem Separation**
   - AI-powered separation using Demucs v4 (hybrid) or MDX-B
   - Separate into: drums, bass, other (melody/instruments)
   - Peak-normalize each stem
   - Phase-align to original audio
   - Server-side processing

2. **Module Toggles**
   - Drums module (auto-chop transients)
   - Bass module (808 extractor)
   - Melody module (instrument one-shots)
   - Enable/disable each module independently
   - Preview before adding to library

3. **Drums Auto-Chop**
   - **Onset Detection:**
     - Adaptive peak picking with onset strength envelope
     - Lower volume threshold for quiet percussion
     - Guard time: 40-60ms minimum slice duration
     - Avoid micro-slices with intelligent grouping
   
   - **Slice Conditioning:**
     - Snap to nearest zero-crossing (±5ms)
     - Tail trim: detect decay crossing -60 dBFS or max 1.2s
     - Add 2-5ms fade-in/out for de-clicking
   
   - **Classification (Optional v2):**
     - Heuristic bucketing: kick/snare/hat/tom/cymbal/perc
     - Spectral centroid & rolloff analysis
     - Sub-energy ratio (<120 Hz) for kick detection
     - Transient sharpness measurement
   
   - **Naming Convention:**
     - Format: `DRUM_[type]_[idx]_[−LUFS]_[len_ms].wav`
     - Example: `DRUM_KICK_01_-12LUFS_450ms.wav`

4. **Bass / 808 Extractor**
   - **Pre-Processing:**
     - Low-pass filter at 180-220 Hz (24 dB/oct)
     - DC offset removal
     - Mono conversion
   
   - **Fundamental Tracking:**
     - YIN/pyin algorithm for pitch detection
     - Discard unstable F0 segments (stdev > 8-12 cents over 200ms)
     - Track root note and octave
   
   - **Suitability Score (0-100):**
     - SNR_sub (energy <120 Hz / total): ≥0.65 → 40 points
     - F0 stability (lower stdev better) → 25 points
     - Crest factor (avoid over-compression) → 10 points
     - Spectral template match (vs. "good 808" reference) → 25 points
   
   - **Cleanup:**
     - Dynamic low-pass (120-3kHz based on centroid)
     - Gentle tilt EQ if mid harmonics dominate
     - Optional de-reverb (spectral gating) for room tails
   
   - **Best Clip Selection:**
     - Filter segments >300ms with score ≥70
     - Select highest scoring segment
     - Trim to 500-1500ms duration
     - Preserve zero-crossing boundaries
     - Loudness-normalize to -12 to -9 LUFS short-term
   
   - **Metadata:**
     - Root note (from F0)
     - Note name (e.g., C2, F#1)
     - Length in milliseconds
     - Quality score
   
   - **Naming Convention:**
     - Format: `BASS_808_[Note][oct]_Score[xx]_Len[ms].wav`
     - Example: `BASS_808_C2_Score85_Len750ms.wav`

5. **Melodic One-Shots (Instruments)**
   - **Event Detection:**
     - Harmonic-percussive source separation (HPSS) on "other" stem
     - Note onset detection via spectral flux + thresholding
     - Separate sustained notes from transients
   
   - **Processing:**
     - Short de-reverb pass
     - Gate to decay -50 dBFS
     - Preserve 10-30ms attack transient
     - Light spectral gating for noise reduction
     - Optional tilt EQ
   
   - **Pitch Labeling:**
     - Median F0 over sustain period
     - Reject noisy segments (low harmonicity)
     - Note name detection
   
   - **Naming Convention:**
     - Format: `INST_[Instrument?]_Note[XX]_Len[ms].wav`
     - Example: `INST_SYNTH_A3_Len1200ms.wav`
     - Instrument label optional (requires classifier)

6. **Review Screen**

### Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: No feature should require more than 3 clicks
2. **Visual Clarity**: Waveforms and audio must be immediately understandable
3. **Fast Feedback**: Every action should have instant visual feedback
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features hidden until needed
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Same interactions work the same everywhere
